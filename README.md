# ThoughtStuff.Caching

> The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure **thought-stuff**. 
> He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. 
> Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, 
> so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.

&mdash; Fred P. Brooks
